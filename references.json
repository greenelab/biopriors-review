    "abstract": "State-of-the-art models for semantic segmentation are based on adaptations of\nconvolutional networks that had originally been designed for image\nclassification. However, dense prediction and image classification are\nstructurally different. In this work, we develop a new convolutional network\nmodule that is specifically designed for dense prediction. The presented module\nuses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual\ninformation without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact\nthat dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field\nwithout loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context\nmodule increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nsystems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification\nnetworks to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can\nincrease accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious\nchallenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than\nthe number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even\nwhen using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which\nthe input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs.\nImproving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an\nimportant impact in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a\nparticular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the\namount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number\nof examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations\nof classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their\nfirst layer: each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there\nare hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which\nconsiderably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea\nthat we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input\nfeature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed),\nand then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction\nnetwork) how to map a feature's distributed representation to the vector of\nparameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the\nweights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). We\nshow experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical\nstudies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of\nparameters and the error rate of the classifier.",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enabled a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what the relevant factors are and how they work together. Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach, AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in humans. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency maps.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup></jats:p>",

RBP binding is known to be affected by both the sequence and structure of RNAs. Deep learning can be used to learn generalizable representations of raw data and has improved state of the art in several fields such as image classification, speech recognition and even genomics. Previous work on RBP binding has either used shallow models that combine sequence and structure or deep models that use only the sequence. Here we combine both abilities by augmenting and refining the original Deepbind architecture to capture structural information and obtain significantly better performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>We propose two deep architectures, one a lightweight convolutional network for transcriptome wide inference and another a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network that is suitable for small batches of data. We incorporate computationally predicted secondary structure features as input to our models and show its effectiveness in boosting prediction performance. Our models achieved significantly higher correlations on held out in-vitro test data compared to previous approaches, and generalise well to in-vivo CLIP-SEQ data achieving higher median AUCs than other approaches. We analysed the output from our model for VTS1 and CPO and provided intuition into its working. Our models confirmed known secondary structure preferences for some proteins as well as found new ones where secondary structure might play a role. We also demonstrated the strengths of our model compared to other approaches such as the ability to combine information from long distances along the input.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability</jats:title><jats:p>Software and models are available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/shreshthgandhi/cDeepbind\">https://github.com/shreshthgandhi/cDeepbind</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Contact</jats:title><jats:p><jats:email>ljlee@psi.toronto.edu</jats:email>, <jats:email>frey@psi.toronto.edu</jats:email></jats:p></jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Genes are regulated through enhancer sequences, in which transcription factor binding motifs and their specific arrangements (syntax) form a cis-regulatory code. To understand the relationship between motif syntax and transcription factor binding, we train a deep learning model that uses DNA sequence to predict base-resolution binding profiles of four pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Klf4. We interpret the model to accurately map hundreds of thousands of motifs in the genome, learn novel motif representations and identify rules by which motifs and syntax influence transcription factor binding. We find that instances of strict motif spacing are largely due to retrotransposons, but that soft motif syntax influences motif interactions at protein and nucleosome range. Most strikingly, Nanog binding is driven by motifs with a strong preference for ∼10.5 bp spacings corresponding to helical periodicity. Interpreting deep learning models applied to high-resolution binding data is a powerful and versatile approach to uncover the motifs and syntax of cis-regulatory sequences.</jats:p>",
