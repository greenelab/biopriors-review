## Abstract {.page_break_before}
In biomedical applications of machine learning, it is often the case that relevant information has a rich structure that is not easily encoded as real-valued predictors.
Examples of such structured data include DNA or RNA sequence, gene sets or pathways, gene interaction or coexpression networks, ontologies, and phylogenetic trees.
In this review, we highlight recent examples of machine learning models that incorporate structured data into model training or use structure to constrain model architecture.
For future machine learning applications in biomedicine, particularly when sample size is limited or model interpretability is critical, incorporating prior knowledge in the form of structured data will remain a useful approach.
We foresee continued innovation and critical evaluation in this area going forward.
