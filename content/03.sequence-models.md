## Sequence-Constrained Models

1. Use in regulatory biology (methylation, histone marks, TFs, splicing)
    a. Early examples
        * 10.1126/science.1254806 (can cite as an early example of using
          hand-engineered features as input to a 2-layer MLP, preceded most
          CNN examples on sequence data -> splicing exon inclusion prediction)
        * 10.1038/nbt.3300 (CNN for prediction of DNA/RNA binding protein
          sequence specificity)
        * 10.1038/nmeth.3547 (CNN for multi-task variant effect prediction
          from noncoding genome, one of the earlier examples of CNN on genomic
          sequence data)
        * 10.1101/gr.200535.11 (CNN for prediction of chromatin accessibility
          from DNA sequence, evaluated to predict effects of SNPs)
    b. More recent examples

2. Use in variant calling
    * 10.1038/nbt.4235 (actually works on images of read pileups, but uses sequence context)
    * 10.1038/s41467-019-09025-z (single molecule sequencing: PacBio/ONT, works on featurization of sequence
      defined in paper, outperforms ^ on these)
    * 10.1101/097469 (similar to DeepVariant, but works on raw sequences rather than images,
      \+ less preprocessing/claims to learn more info directly from sequences)
    * 10.1101/601450 (calling of short indels using sequence information)
3. Use in mutation detection
    * 10.1038/s41467-019-09027-x (mutation detection in tumors)
4. Use in CRISPR guide selection
    * 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005807 (shows that a wide variety of sequence attributes
      are useful for predicting cleavage efficiency, didn't use contextual info?)
    * 10.1038/nbt.3437, 10.1038/s41551-017-0178-6 (models for predicting on-target efficacy
      and off-target effects, uses contextual info about sequence i.e. order 2+ features)
    * 10.1038/nbt.4061 (CNN-based model for Cpf1 activity prediction,
      convolutions of length 5 on one-hot encoded sequence)
    * 10.1186/s13059-018-1459-4 (similar to ^ but for Cas9, also uses ChIP-seq
      data)
    * 10.1101/636472 (similar to ^)
    * 10.1101/505602 (uses STRING -> gene network-based features, in addition
      to sequence features, for on-target efficacy prediction)
