## Conclusions and future directions

As the quantity and richness of biomedical data has expanded, unique opportunities have arisen for integrating structured data into machine learning models.
Going forward, there is an outstanding need for benchmarks comparing these approaches across diverse datasets and prediction problems, along the lines of the evaluation of network- and pathway-based models of breast cancer in [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034796] but updated and expanded to include recent methods and applications.
Ideally, improved benchmarking will lead to a better understanding of which datasets can benefit from which approaches, allowing modelers to weigh the inherent tradeoffs when applying similar models to a new dataset.
Many of the methods described in this review have open-source implementations available; however, increased availability of performant and extensible implementations of the models and algorithms described in this review would also facilitate further use and development.
