![Schematic showing the main categories of models incorporating structured biological data covered in this review. The first panel shows an example of a model operating on sequence data, the second panel shows a model in which dimension reduction is constrained by the connections in a gene network, and the third panel shows a neural network with structure constrained by a phylogeny or ontology.](images/all_models_revised.svg){.white}
