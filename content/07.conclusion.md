## Conclusions and future directions

As the quantity and richness of biomedical data has increased, sequence repositories and interaction databases have expanded and become more robust.
This raises opportunities to integrate these resources into the structure of machine learning models.
There have been several past attempts to benchmark and compare approaches to integrating structured data into predictive models in biomedicine, including the evaluation in [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034796] and more recent studies in [@arxiv:1905.02295] and [@arxiv:1910.09600].
Going forward, building on and broadening benchmarking efforts such as these will be vital, improving our understanding of the suitability of problem domains and datasets for the classes of methods described in this review.

Many methods described in this review have open-source implementations available; however, increased availability of performant and extensible implementations of these models and algorithms would facilitate further use and development.
In the future, we foresee that incorporating structured biomedical data will become commonplace for improving model interpretability and boosting performance when sample size is limited.
