## Other constrained models

### Ontology-constrained models

1. Phenotype prediction
    * 10.1038/nmeth.4627 (gene ontology -> NN structure, to predict effects of mutations on growth in yeast)
2. Function prediction
    * 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx624 (GO hierarchy relationships -> NN structure, for function prediction)
    * 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx252 (PPI network + tissue ontology -> function prediction)

### Otherwise constrained models

1. Cell cycle information
    * 10.1038/nbt.3102
    * 10.1101/526848
   (in principle the denoising method could be generalized to other gene sets, but here they used cell cycle-relevant gene sets and emphasized the utility of this)
2. Circadian rhythms: 10.1073/pnas.1619320114 (circular node autoencoder for modeling periodic gene expression)
3. TAD/3D chromatin structure information? Can probably find some examples of this
