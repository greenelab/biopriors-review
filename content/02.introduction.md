## Introduction

1. Why is this necessary? Where do traditional models fail?
   * Biological data is often "wide" (n << p), so it can be difficult for models to learn feature covariance structure directly from the data.
   * For "tall" data (n >> p) as is often used in non-biological ML, sufficiently flexible models (NNs, etc) can effectively learn covariance structure directly from the data, and incorporating structured priors is often unnecessary.
   * Frequently, there is no natural way to encode biological knowledge as real-valued features: knowledge can take many forms (pathways, networks, hierarchies, ontologies/knowledge graphs).
     Most ML models operate on real-valued features, so modelers must be creative when deciding how to constrain the model based on the structure of the relevant biological knowledge.

2. What is a "biologically motivated constraint"? How is this different from
  regularization?
    a. Regularization refers specifically to adding a smoothness or penalty term to the model's loss function to reflect a biological desideratum.
        * For example, a model using the expression of genes as predictors could have a penalty requiring genes in the same biological pathway to have a similar role in the predictive model.
        * Or, a model using eQTL expression levels to predict a phenotype could have a penalty requiring genes that are nearby on the chromosome to have a similar role in the predictive model. (could give explicit examples of loss functions if it makes things clearer)
    b. We use "constraint" as a more general term that can take many forms, depending on the choice of machine learning model.
        * Regularization is a type of biological constraint, but there exist constraints that do not fit the definition of regularization given above.
        * Example: DCell (Ma et al 2018). Not really an explicit "regularizer" mathematically speaking, but the structure of the NN is biologically inspired and constrained using biological knowledge.
    c. Note that the term "constraint" has a specific meaning in mathematical optimization (one might minimize some function f(x) subject to a constraint g(x) > c). Herein, we use the term more generally, and none of the constraints we discuss take this form. (should we come up with a different term to use for this?)
