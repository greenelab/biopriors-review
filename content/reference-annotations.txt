Reference Annotations
=====================

Sequence models:

[**]: BPNet (https://doi.org/10.1101/737981)

This paper describes BPNet, a neural network for predicting transcription
factor (TF) binding profiles from raw DNA sequence. The model is able to
accurately infer the spacing and periodicity of pluripotency-related TFs in
mouse embryonic stem cells, leading to an improved understanding of the motif
syntax of combinatorial TF binding in cell development.

[*]: cDeepbind (https://doi.org/10.1101/345140)

cDeepbind is a neural network model for predicting RNA binding protein (RBP)
specificity from RNA sequence and secondary structure information. The authors
show that this combined approach provides an improvement over previous models
that use only sequence information.

[*]: DeepDiff (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty612)

DeepDiff uses a long short-term memory neural network to predict differential
gene expression from the spatial structure of histone modification
measurements. The network has a multi-task objective, enabling gene expression
predictions to be made simultaneously in multiple cell types.

[**]: DeepVariant (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4235)

This paper describes DeepVariant, a neural network model for distinguishing
true genetic variants from errors in next-generation DNA sequencing data. The
model adapts techniques from the image processing community to fit a model on
images of read pileups around candidate variants, using information about the
sequence around the candidate variant site to make predictions about the true
genotype at the site.

Network/pathway models:

[**]: PLIER (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1)

This paper describes a "pathway-level information extractor" (PLIER), a method
for reducing the dimension of gene expression data in a manner that aligns with
known biological pathways or informative gene sets. The method can also reduce
the effects of technical noise. The authors show that PLIER can be used to
improve cell type inference and as a component in eQTL studies.

[**]: netNMF-sc (https://doi.org/10.1101/544346)

netNMF-sc is a dimension reduction method that uses network information to
"smooth" a matrix factorization of single-cell gene expression data, such that
genes that are connected in the network have a similar low-dimensional
representation. Inclusion of network information is particularly useful when
analyzing single-cell expression data, due to its ability to mitigate "dropouts"
and other sources of variability that are present at the single cell level.

[*]: attribution priors (https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10670v1)

This paper describes "model attribution priors", or a method for constraining
a machine learning model's behavior during training with prior beliefs or
expectations about the data or problem structure. As an example of this concept,
the authors show that incorporation of network data improves the performance of
a model for drug response prediction in acute myeloid leukemia.

[*]: PIMKL (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41540-019-0086-3)

In this paper, the authors present an algorithm for combining gene expression
and copy number data with prior information, such as gene networks and pathways
or gene set annotations, to predict survival in breast cancer. The weights
learned by the model are also interpretable, providing a putative set of
explanatory features for the prediction task.

[**]: creNET (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-19635-0)

This work describes creNET, a regression model for gene expression data that
uses information about gene regulation to differentially weight or penalize
gene sets that are co-regulated. The authors show that the model can be used to
predict phenotype from gene expression data in clinical trials. The model also
provides interpretable weights for each gene regulator.

Other models:

[**]: DCell (https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4627)

This paper presents DCell, a neural network model for prediction of yeast
growth phenotype from gene deletions. The structure of the neural network is
constrained by the relationships encoded in the Gene Ontology (GO), enabling
predictions for a given input to be interpreted based on the subsystems of GO
that they activate. Thus, the neural network can be seen as connecting genotype
to phenotype.

[*]: DeepGO (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx624)

Here, the authors describe a method for predicting protein function from amino
acid sequence, incorporating the dependency structure of the Gene Ontology (GO)
into their neural network used for prediction. Using the GO information
provides a performance improvement over similar models that do not incorporate
this information.

[**]: NetBITE (https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06603v2)

This paper describes a method for using prior knowledge about drug targets to
inform the structure of a tree ensemble model, used for predicting IC50 drug
sensitivity from gene expression data. The model also uses a protein
interaction network to "smooth" the gene weights, such that genes that are
related in the network will have a similar influence on predictions.
